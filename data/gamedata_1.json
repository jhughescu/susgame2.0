We host independent forums to reduce potential conflicts of interest between what individual countries’ wishes and the interests of the larger group. We strive to find consensus across very different geographies and cultures.",

Nations from Germany, to Russia, Turkey and Ukraine are obliged to participate in our processes. We are working collectively to achieve the highest global standards in food safety and quality. Our 2027 strategy reinforces our commitment to sustainability with a focus on transparency, digitalisation and traceability."

Globally we have over 20 million users and 40,000 partners. We’ve rescued 30 million meals.",

I co-developed a platform called RackNow that enables food producers, eateries and retailers to trade with one another directly, in real-time, in local areas. It is increasing local trade, lowering costs and getting more fresh, local produce onto our tables.",
